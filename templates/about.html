              Hi! I'm Onur, a passionate programmer from Istanbul, Turkey,
              currently studying at the University of Toronto. I've been living
              in Toronto since 2017. I enjoy building creative and functional
              software, especially in Python, C, Java, JavaScript, and R.
              I'm particularly interested in projects that involve graphics,
              user interaction, and backend systems.
            </p>

            <!-- Background, interests, and current goals -->
            <p id="intro-2">
              From a young age, I have been drawn to math, physics, and
              problem solving. With both of my parents working as accountants,
              I also developed a strong interest in economics. These influences
              shaped my academic and professional direction. Today, I focus on
              Software Engineering and Economics, with a growing passion for
              Data Science where I combine analytical thinking with technical skills
              to explore meaningful problems. You can explore some of my work
              on the Projects page.
